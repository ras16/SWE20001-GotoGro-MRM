# SWE20001-GotoGro-MRM

## Background
Goto Grocery is a member-based grocery store based in Hawthorn. The company offers quality grocery items for our members.

Currently the company is using a paper-based system to record their members details and their sales records. Recently, the company has found it difficult to manage their members' expectations. In particular, the company finds it difficult to satisfy their members' grocery needs. The company has often ordered items that are not needed by their members.

The company needs an application that can help them manage their members records and inform them their grocery needs in a timely manner.

The application must offer a graphical user interface. However, the reports generated need to be in a format that can be easily translated into CSV (comma separated values) files for further processing.
